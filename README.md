# Learning the Basics of LangChain

LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to simplify the development process, allowing you to focus on creating innovative solutions.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Begin by installing LangChain using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install langchain
    ```

2. **Basic Concepts**:
    - **Chains**: Chains are sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities. They can be simple or complex, depending on your application's needs.
    - **Prompts**: Prompts are the inputs given to LLMs. Crafting effective prompts is crucial for getting accurate and relevant responses.
    - **Models**: LangChain supports various LLMs. You can choose the one that best fits your requirements.

3. **Example Usage**:
    ```python
    from langchain import Chain, Prompt

    # Define a simple prompt
    prompt = Prompt("Translate the following English text to French: {text}")

    # Create a chain with the prompt
    chain = Chain(prompt)

    # Run the chain with input data
    result = chain.run({"text": "Hello, how are you?"})
    print(result)  # Output: "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?"
    ```

4. **Documentation**: For more detailed information, refer to the [LangChain documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/).

By following these steps, you can start leveraging the power of LangChain to build sophisticated language-based applications.
