    "# Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrievers are Langchain chain components that allow you to retrieve documents using an unstructured query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a movie plot about a robot that wants to be human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents are any unstructured text that you want to retrieve. A retriever often uses a vector store as its underlying data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrievers are a key component for creating models that can take advantage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you loaded embeddings and created a vector index of Movie plots - in this example, the movie plots are the documents, and a retriever could be used to give a model context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will create a retriever to retrieve documents from the movie plots vector index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neo4jVector\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neo4jVector is a Langchain vector store that uses a Neo4j database as the underlying data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Neo4jVector to generate embeddings, store them in the database and retrieve them.\n",
    "Querying a vector index\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the following code that creates a Neo4jVector from the moviePlots index you created."
